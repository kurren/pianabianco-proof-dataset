# Proof Dataset — Alessandro L. Piana Bianco

This repository is a versioned, citable dataset that supports fast evaluation by humans and recruiting agents.

**Principle:** No claim without a trace.

## How to evaluate in 3 minutes
1) Open the Proof Map (human-readable):  
   - https://pianabianco.com/proof/

2) Verify the machine-readable dataset files in this repo:
- proof_map.json (claims → case studies → evidence links)
- career.json (role history, skills taxonomy, outcomes)
- hire.json (positioning + availability + contact)
- schema-person.jsonld (structured Person schema)
- llms.txt (LLM discovery entry point)
- sitemap.xml (crawl hints)

3) Verify integrity:
- Compare SHA-256 checksums in `provenance.json` against the files in this release.

## Intended use (agentic hiring)
- Automated screening and due diligence
